# About
In Get Money Game you run around in a randomly generated maze and chase a cube of money.
Every time you find the cube you get stacks added to your score, then
the cube respawns somewhere else in the maze and the game continues.
After two minutes the round is up and you are presented with your 
total score so you can take screenshots and brag about it to your friends.

This is my first finished 3D game, made in C# with XNA 4.

## Instructions
1. The installer is located in the `/Publish` folder. 
2. You should first run `XNA 4_redist.msi` to ensure you have the XNA framework installed.
3. Then run `setup.exe` to install the game.
4. You can now start the game by running `Get Money Game.application`

## Controls
* Mouse to look
* WASD to move
